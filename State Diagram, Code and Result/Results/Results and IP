From the Simulation obtained, it is evident that at the positive edge of clock, whenever the entry sensor is at Logic ‘1’ and a correct password ‘a’ or ‘1010’ is provided, the LED blinks showing the Opening of the door in the ‘Right_Pass’ state.
But, if exit sensor is at Logic ‘1’, the LED comes to Logic ‘0’ which shows that the door has closed and returned to the ‘Idle’ state.
Also, if entry sensor is at logic ‘1’ and a wrong password, ‘5’ in this case, is provided, then the LED will remain at Logic ‘0’ showing that the door remains closed in the ‘Wrong_Pass’ State.
Finally, when both entry and exit sensors are at Logic ‘1’ together, then the LED goes to Logic ‘0’ and a right password would be required to be provided again to change to the state ‘Right_Pass’ and open the door.
The custom IP and an SoC block diagram was created in the Xilinx Vivado Software.
The custom IP has user ports password[3:0], which is connected to some keypad to enter password, and LED to show whether a person/car gets access to enter or not.
The other inputs of the IP that are entry and exit are connected to AXI Interconnect and gets data through the AXI peripheral.
